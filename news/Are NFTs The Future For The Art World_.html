        <main>The evolution of digital spaces has introduced not only realistic digital avatars but also fuelled new
            approaches for digital ownership. As a result, the newly emerging online marketplace has changed
            conventional approaches for creating and exerting ownership of digital assets. The scope for NFT art has
            been growing profoundly in recent times since the $69 million NFT sales in 2021. A digital artist known as
            Beeple created massive waves in the crypto space when his artwork sold as an NFT. Subsequently, many NFT
            artists have come up with unique creations fetching unreal financial returns. </main>
        <main>However, the hype around the NFT art world creates many prominent concerns which need answers. Will NFT
            revolutionize the art world completely by bringing every piece of real art to the digital space? How will
            NFTs gain the trust of art collectors and artists for serving as a representation of original art? Let us
            find out what NFTs hold for the future of the art world in the following discussion.</main>
        <main>Effect of NFTs on Existing Business Models of the Art World</main>
        <main>The easiest way to identify the future of NFT art marketplace alternatives available now is to learn how
            NFTs present new perspectives on business models in the art world. One NFT sold for $69 million, and other
            artists just started putting up their works for auction. In the initial days, few would have identified how
            the lines of code representing an artwork on blockchain can bring in such exclusive financial returns.
        </main>
        <main>The phenomenon created by Beeple led to a revolution that garnered momentum in the next few months. As a
            matter of fact, the growth of NFTs led to revenues amounting to almost $3.5 billion in initial three
            quarters of 2021. Despite a few initial setbacks, the NFT art market has been growing at a steady pace while
            introducing new paradigms in a sector driven by conventions. </main>
        <main>Artists are highly cautious about the prospects of using NFT for art gallery exhibitions and auctions.
            Why? NFTs are practically challenging the business models stipulated by auction houses and art galleries.
            The traditional business models of art galleries and auction houses have never been challenged in years.
            However, such traditional institutions are also seeking opportunities to reach a massive global audience
            without the intervention of any intermediaries. For example, a renowned NFT art marketplace like OpenSea or
            Nifty Gateway could help art galleries and auction houses reach more buyers. </main>
        <main>Such prospects could also drive new opportunities for artists who have not been able to garner acceptance
            in the traditional art market. For example, female artists and artists from the African continent can make
            the most of an NFT art platform to take their work to thousands of interested buyers. For example, the
            partnership between Art X, a Nigerian art fair, and the SuperRare NFT marketplace shows promising roads
            ahead for NFT artwork. </main>
