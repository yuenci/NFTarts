        <main>OpenSea is an American online non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace headquartered in New York City. The
            company was founded by Devin Finzer and Alex Atallah in 2017. </main>
        <main>OpenSea offers a marketplace allowing for non-fungible tokens to be sold directly at a fixed price, or
            through an auction, based on the Ethereum ERC-721 standard, the layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum
            Polygon, the KIP-7 standard for Klaytn, and the SPL standard for Solana. </main>
        <main>In 2021, following a heightened interest in non-fungible tokens, the company's revenue reached $95 million
            in February 2021 and $2.75 billion in September of that year. By January 2022, the company had been valued
            at $13.3 billion and has been considered the largest non-fungible token marketplace.</main>
        <main>After a 2018 pre-seed round by Y Combinator, OpenSea raised $2.1 million in venture capital (including
            from Animoca Brands) in November 2019. </main>
        <main>In December 2020, OpenSea announced that any user can mint NFTs on its platform for free. Later, in March
            2021, OpenSea announced NFT collections would no longer need OpenSea's previous approval to be listed. This
            decision was later criticized for allowing rampant NFT plagiarism on the platform. </main>
        <main>On September 17, 2021, OpenSea released an app for Android and iOS. The app allows for browsing the
            marketplace, but not buying or selling NFTs.[9][10] The same month, OpenSea admitted that an employee
            engaged in insider trading. OpenSea's Head of Product hoarded NFTs just before they were featured in the
            homepage. </main>
        <main>In January 2022, Twitter announced that it would use OpenSeaâ€™s API to let people create hexagonal shaped
            profile pictures of their NFTs. That month, OpenSea acquired Ethereum wallet-maker Dharma Labs, and OpenSea
            reimbursed users about $1.8 million after a user interface bug allowed users to buy more than $1 million
            worth of NFTs at a discount. </main>
        <main>On January 27, 2022, OpenSea announced it would limit how many NFTs a user can create using the free
            minting tool. The following day, OpenSea reversed the decision following user backlash and later admitted
            that 80% of NFTs created with the tool were plagiarism or spam. </main>
        <main>On February 19, 2022, some users began to report that some of their NFTs disappeared. OpenSea later
            revealed a phishing attack had took place on its platform via an exploit in the Wyvern Platform. The company
            denied rumors the source of the theft was their website, its listing systems, emails from the company, or an
            upgraded contract system. On February 20, 2022, news reporting alleged that $1.7 million in NFTs had been
            stolen in the phishing attack. </main>
        <main>In March 2022, OpenSea announced that it would block accounts subject to United States sanctions. </main>
        <main>In April 2022, OpenSea gave users the ability to buy and sell popular Solana NFTs on OpenSea's Solana
            beta. This feature was announced back in November 2021.</main>
        <main>On April 25, 2022, OpenSea announced the acquisition of the NFT marketplace aggregator company Gem.xyz
