        <main>This article will go through the easiest way to create and sell NFT art and Crypto art and sell it on
            platforms such as The Foundation App, SuperRare, Opensea, and many other marketplaces. </main>
        <main>If you are an NFT artist then you most probably would be very interested in the opportunity to create
            money from your digital art. Well NFT allows you to do just that. All you have to do is create digital art,
            create a digital wallet, mint and choose the right platform to do so. </main>
        <main>So, let’s guide you through the process!</main>
        <main>How to create NFT Art?</main>
        <main>There are no requirements for creating NFT art. Because NFT art itself is something so broad and
            undefined.</main>
        <main>All you have to do is to have certain skills.</main>
        <main>You can create NFT art with platforms such as Photoshop (classic), Unity or Blender. Some artworks are so
            simple that it looks like they were created in Paint. Yes, we are serious.</main>
        <main>Where and How to Sell NFT Art?</main>
        <main>We will try our best to explain how and where to sell your NFT art in a few simple steps.</main>
        <main>Log in with a Wallet</main>
        <main>Upload your NFT. It could be in the following formats – File types supported: JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, MP4,
            WEBM, MP3, WAV, OGG, GLB, GLTF. Max size: 100 MB</main>
        <main>Add name of the NFT, Description, Links</main>
        <main>Choose a category or colleciton (different topics etc.)</main>
        <main>Enter supply – 1 or more. Each supply is unique.</main>
        <main>Choose a Blockchain Platform (Ethereum is the most popular)</main>
        <main>Choose to freeza metadata or no – freezing means that the ETF can not be edited</main>
        <main>What is NFT minting?</main>
        <main>The NFT minting is actually a term that stands for the process that goes on when a certain platform
            processes your crypto artwork and lists it for sale.</main>
        <main>NFT minting is only possible when you connect your digital wallet to the platform and pay for transaction
            fees. After that you are eligible for selling your art for crypto.</main>
        <main>Price: How much does my NFT art cost?</main>
        <main>Most platforms allow artists to determine how they want their art to be sold and bought. There are mainly
            2 approaches for selling:</main>
        <main>Auction</main>
        <main>Sale Price</main>
        <main>I suggest that you put your artwork on auction and decide on your own whether to accept or not investors’
            bids.</main>
        <main>The average price for NFT artworks is about 3 ETH which in USD is over $5,000. Everything depends on the
            platform, but most of the time highest bids are between 0.007 ETH and 10.000 ETH.</main>
        <main>Getting Paid When you NFT is Sold & Reselled: What’s a Royalty Percentage in NFT art?</main>
        <main>The Royalty percentage in NFT art allows you to get paid every single time when someone resells your work.
            It is calculated in percentages and it all depends on you. </main>
        <main>A popular royalty percentage is between 10-30%.</main>
        <main>You set the reward that you want once you’re on the NFT Marketplace of your choice, you upload your file
            and mint it.</main>
        <main>How can you earn and accept rewards by buying, selling and investing in NFTs? </main>
        <main>You can recieve profit once someone buys your NFT.</main>
        <main>If you want to have profit, you need to set a price that is higher than all the gas fees and other fees
            related to the NFT Marketplace, wallets set-up and so on. The gas fee changes all the time, depending on how
            many people are buying. The more buyers – the higher gas fee.</main>
        <main>Profit when someone re-sells your NFT</main>
        <main>NFT Staking (same as lending)</main>
        <main>You can generate income by “lending” your NFT (as collateral) and recieveing rewards (interest). Rewards
            can be fungible tokens of the platform or new-minted NFTs. The more rare NFT you’re staking, the higher
            annual return you will be offered.</main>
        <main>This means that you’re locking it away (as collateral) and becoming a validator – meaning you help with
            the process of transactions, helping process blocks on the Blockchain. You do this to get a reward. Buyers
            believe that they will recieve this anual percent return (APR) if staking their NFT for 12 months.</main>
