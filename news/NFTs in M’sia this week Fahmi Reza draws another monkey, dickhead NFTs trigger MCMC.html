        <main>This week, some “controversial” events have occurred in the world of NFTs, so buckle up because we have
            two wild stories to share.</main>
        <main>But rest assured, the piece ends on a milder note. Still, given the… slightly NSFW turn this piece takes,
            maybe don’t read this piece in front of your family or colleagues.</main>
        <main>Fahmi Reza has joined the chat</main>
        <main>Political graphic artist Fahmi Reza has been making plenty of headlines over the years for this
            provocative artwork. His most recent stunt was drawing the villain in The PowerPuff Girls, Mojo Jojo,
            wearing royal garb.</main>
        <main>The piece was meant as a satirical jab at the Sultan of Selangor’s purchase of a painting that portrays
            members of parliament as animals including monkeys and frogs.</main>
        <main>The artist was arrested over the cartoon drawing and was investigated under the Sedition Act as well as
            the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998.</main>
        <main>He later tweeted that he was banned from leaving the country, and followed up with an announcement that he
            will be selling an open edition NFT entitled Monyet Istana (Palace Monkey). This differs from the Mojo Jojo
            artwork as it depicts a generic monkey instead of The PowerPuff Girls character.</main>
        <main>An open edition NFT means any number of editions can be minted of that one artwork. This means that it’s
            less exclusive, but by keeping the NFT available to be minted for only 48 hours, Fahmi is able to limit the
            supply.</main>
        <main>The NFT is being sold for 0.05 BNB (RM 88.26 at the time of writing). Within 24 hours of its release, the
            NFT has already raised over RM33.7K. </main>
        <main>However, Fahmi claims he’s not profiting from the sale, as all funds raised are going to the Freedom of
            Expression Legal Defence Fund, which supports Malaysians who are investigated and prosecuted for exercising
            their right to freedom of expression.</main>
        <main>According to a press release, this NFT fundraiser “intends to mimic the actions of the Selangor Sultan who
            plans to auction off the painting for charity one day”.</main>
        <main>Many Twitter users have been supportive of the NFT, but there were also those who were quick to bring up
            the fact that Fahmi Reza has previously refused to sell his artwork as NFTs.</main>
        <main>In a Twitter Spaces event hosted by NFXT though, Fahmi was reported to have said that he will not be
            minting any old artwork or creating artwork solely for NFTs for now.</main>
        <main>On OpenSea, there is an account under his name that has minted several of his past works, but as there is
            no verified badge, it might be run by someone else who’s profiting off his work.</main>
