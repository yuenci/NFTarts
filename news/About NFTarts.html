        <main>About Us</main>
        <main>We are an art society at Asia Pacific University (APU) that highlights the current trends in
            cryptocurrency, namely Non-Fungible Token (NFT). NFT enables digital assets to have their own ownership
            since every record is preserved digitally and uniquely via blockchain technology. In this case, every
            digital asset will be unique and exclusively belongs to the person who purchased it using cryptocurrency.
            Digital assets relate to NFT arts, including digital arts, music, photography, and so on. APU students can
            discover the most recent news on NFT arts and some fantastic artwork from well-known NFT artists on our
            pages. Not only that, but this website enables the exchange of ideas with APU students about the NFT arts.
        </main>
        <main>Our story</main>
        <main>NFTarts has been organized in APU since 2022. We aim to promote the culture of NFT and arts to the
            students at APU. Collecting NFT arts is one of the inspiring and passionate hobbies in this digital era. The
            founder of NFTarts urges APU’s students to learn more about NFT arts and develop it as a hobby in their
            daily lives. Many upcoming events will be organized either on the campus or off-campus to build the
            connection between the students and NFT arts.</main>
        <main>Who are we?</main>
        <main>We are APU students who develop APU NFTarts society. Anyone interested in NFT arts is encouraged to join
            us to become our members to continue this culture at APU. We really hope that everyone at APU is aware of
            NFT arts and having fun with it.</main>
        <main>We believe…</main>
        <main>NFT is easy to learn for new collectors and creators. Unlike the traditional market, we may now trade the
            artworks on a large scale via platforms like OpenSea. In comparison to traditional artworks, NFTs are much
            more practical. Creating, selling, and distributing NFTs has never been simpler for us. To keep the
            expensive artworks, we do not need any special equipment. The artworks may be accessed and exchanged
            instantly from mobile phones and desktops. At the same time, NFTs’ irreversible digital signature provides
            collectors and creators with unparalleled levels of trust.</main>
