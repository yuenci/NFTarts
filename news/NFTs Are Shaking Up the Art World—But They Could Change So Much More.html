        <main>Just a few months ago, Jazmine Boykins was posting her artwork online for free. The 20-year-old digital
            artist’s dreamy animations of Black life were drawing plenty of likes, comments and shares, but not much
            income, aside from money she made selling swag with her designs between classes at North Carolina A&T State
            University.</main>
        <main>But Boykins has recently been selling the same pieces for thousands of dollars each, thanks to an emerging
            technology upending the rules of digital ownership: NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. NFTs—digital tokens tied
            to assets that can be bought, sold and traded—are enabling artists like Boykins to profit from their work
            more easily than ever. “At first, I didn’t know if it was trustworthy or legit,” says Boykins, who goes by
            the online handle “BLACKSNEAKERS” and who has sold more than $60,000 in NFT art over the past six months.
            “But to see digital art being bought at these prices, it’s pretty astounding. It’s given me the courage to
            keep going.”</main>
        <main>NFTs are having their big-bang moment: collectors and speculators have spent more than $200 million on an
            array of NFT-based artwork, memes and GIFs in the past month alone, according to market tracker
            NonFungible.com, compared with $250 million throughout all of 2020. And that was before the digital artist
            Mike Winkelmann, known as Beeple, sold a piece for a record-setting $69 million at famed auction house
            Christie’s on March 11—the third highest price ever fetched by any currently living artist, after Jeff Koons
            and David Hockney.</main>
        <main>NFTs are best understood as computer files combined with proof of ownership and authenticity, like a deed.
            Like cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, they exist on a blockchain—a tamper-resistant digital public ledger.
            But like dollars, cryptocurrencies are “fungible,” meaning one bitcoin is always worth the same as any other
            bitcoin. By contrast, NFTs have unique valuations set by the highest bidder, just like a Rembrandt or a
            Picasso. Artists who want to sell their work as NFTs have to sign up with a marketplace, then “mint” digital
            tokens by uploading and validating their information on a blockchain (typically the Ethereum blockchain, a
            rival platform to Bitcoin). Doing so usually costs anywhere from $40 to $200. They can then list their piece
            for auction on an NFT marketplace, similar to eBay.</main>
        <main>At face value, the whole enterprise seems absurd: big-money collectors paying six to eight figures for
            works that can often be seen and shared online for free. Critics have dismissed the NFT art craze as just
            the latest bubble, akin to this year’s boom-and-bust mania around “meme stocks” like GameStop. The
            phenomenon is attracting a strange brew of not just artists and collectors, but also speculators looking to
            get rich off the latest fad.</main>
        <main>A bubble it may be. But many digital artists, fed up after years of creating content that generates visits
            and engagement on Big Tech platforms like Facebook and Instagram while getting almost nothing in return,
            have lunged headlong into the craze. These artists of all kinds—authors, musicians, filmmakers—envision a
            future in which NFTs transform both their creative process and how the world values art, now that it’s
            possible to truly “own” and sell digital art for the first time. “You will have so many people from
            different backgrounds and genres coming in to share their art, connect with people and potentially build a
            career,” Boykins says. “Artists put so much of their time—and themselves—into their work. To see them
            compensated on an appropriate scale, it’s really comforting.” Technologists, meanwhile, say NFTs are the
            latest step toward a long-promised blockchain revolution that could radically transform consumer capitalism,
            with major implications for everything from home loans to health care.</main>
        <main>Digital art has long been undervalued, in large part because it’s so freely available. To help artists
            create financial value for their work, NFTs add the crucial ingredient of scarcity. For some collectors, if
            they know the original version of something exists, they’re more likely to crave the “authentic” piece.
            Scarcity explains why baseball-card collectors, for example, are willing to pay $3.12 million for a piece of
            cardboard with a picture of Honus Wagner, a legendary Pittsburgh Pirate. It’s also why sneakerheads obsess
            over the latest limited-edition drops from Nike and Adidas, and why “pharma bro” Martin Shkreli bought the
            sole copy of Wu-Tang Clan’s Once Upon a Time in Shaolin for $2 million in 2015.</main>
        <main>But baseball cards, sneakers and that Wu-Tang CD all exist in the physical space, so it’s easier to
            understand why they’re worth something. It can be harder to understand why digital art, or any other digital
            file, has value.</main>
        <main>Some digital-art collectors say they’re paying not just for pixels but also for digital artists’ labor–in
            part, the movement is an effort to economically legitimize an emerging art form. “I want you to go on my
            collection and be like, ‘Oh, these are all unique things that stand out,'” says Shaylin Wallace, a
            22-year-old NFT artist and collector. “The artist put so much work into it–and it was sold for the price
            that it deserved.” The movement is also taking shape after many of us have spent most of the past year
            online. If nearly your whole world is virtual, it makes sense to spend money on virtual stuff.</main>
