        <main>Today marks the start of Bitcoin Week 2022 – the world’s largest celebration of the cryptocurrency that
            started it all.</main>
        <main>Attendees of the four-day Miami Beach event can expect to see some of the most prominent figures in the
            crypto and NFT spaces. Speakers include former U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang, Paypal co-founder
            Peter Theil, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, and Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary. Notable
            investors like tennis legend Serena Williams and NFL champion Oddell Beckham Jr., are also making
            appearances.</main>
        <main>Despite its billing as a celebration of Bitcoin, there will also be plenty of NFT-centric events at
            Bitcoin Week 2022. Here are all the ones you can’t miss.</main>
        <main>Bitcoin Renaissance NFT gallery opening</main>
        <main>Bitcoin Week 2022 is launching with an aptly-themed NFT collection: the Bitcoin Rennaissance. It’s set to
            feature work from more than 60 artists including Hitomi Matsui, Drooling Ape Bus Club, and Ross Ulbricht.
            The best part: you don’t have to be present to be a part of the auction– fans at home can own a piece from
            the 10,000 square foot gallery, too.</main>
        <main>Exclusive drops at the TradeStation after-party</main>
        <main>Once the week wraps up, attendees can gain exclusive access to the TradeStation After-Party. The
            invite-only event is slated to feature a set from DJ ANDR3X, an exclusive NFT auction, and of course, an
            open bar.</main>
        <main>Guests will also get an early look at planned drops courtesy of the event’s host, NFT Glee. You can
            request an invite here.</main>
        <main>Satellite events</main>
        <main>Several companies and groups are also taking part in the festivities with a series of satellite events
            hosted outside of the official Bitcoin Week conference. Just bear in mind that these have no direct
            affiliation with the actual event. So if you’re willing to take the plunge, here are some of the most
            interesting NFT events you can participate in at nearby locations.</main>
        <main>Art in Action</main>
        <main>In partnership with Ujamaa, a mobile NFT marketplace geared towards artists of color, Bitcoin Conference
            Kings is hosting the 21 Million Savage Networking Event on April 6th at the Sky Yard. Artists will be in
            attendance to help curate an installation featuring unique artwork produced specifically for the event.
        </main>
        <main>The event will also feature leading Bitcoin personalities as guest speakers to give talks centered around
            their leadership experiences in financial advocacy. Passes will be prioritized towards early RSVPs, so you
            better hurry if this sounds like it’s right up your alley.</main>
        <main>BoredPunks’ party for charity</main>
        <main>Members of the CryptoPunks and BAYC communities have come together to host an invite-only fundraiser on
            April 8th for United Way – a charity that’s recently shown initiative in offering financial assistance to
            families fleeing Ukraine. They’re also known for their efforts in helping working members of the local Miami
            community in achieving financial independence.</main>
        <main>Although not directly an NFT-centric event, guests part of the BAYC community will have the chance to
            network directly with other community members over drinks, live music, and under a noble charitable cause.
        </main>
        <main>Solana Miami</main>
        <main>The Solana Foundation is hosting Solana Miami in partnership with Hurry Up Slowly. It’s an event to
            celebrate the work of the builders, artists, merchants, and users who make up the Solana community. The
            event comes at an exciting time for Solana, as OpenSea recently announced they will add Solana NFTs starting
            April 2022.</main>
        <main>The event runs through April 10 and features a block-long street fair where attendees can make purchases
            using SOL, an NFT gallery highlighting artists in the Solana ecosystem, and much more.</main>
