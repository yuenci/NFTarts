        <main>Profile picture (PFP) non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have come to dominate the NFT ecosystem. As these
            generative avatar projects became astoundingly popular in 2021, their significance has only continued to
            increase as the NFT ecosystem has grown.</main>
        <main>At its core, a PFP NFT is a digital token or artwork that is designed to be displayed as a person’s social
            media profile picture. Many of the world’s most popular NFT collections, such as Bored Apes and Doodles, are
            PFPs.</main>
        <main>PFPs live at the intersection of collectibles and generative art. They’re collectibles in the sense that
            they usually come in large quantities (10,000 or so) and have varying degrees of rarity, somewhat similar to
            trading cards. Yet, PFPs are also generative. They are created using a simple plug-and-play method in which
            users load a variety of traits — like body type, head shape, background color, etc. — into an application
            that will in turn randomly compile vast quantities of NFTs.</main>
        <main>This method has allowed countless artists and developers to launch both original and derivative
            collections in the image of the original PFP project, CryptoPunks. With so many PFP collections saturating
            the NFT market, we’ve compiled a list of the most prominent projects — ranked by overall sales volume — to
            help you understand which ones continue to stand the test of time.</main>
        <main>CryptoPunks</main>
        <main>Whether you’re a total NFT noob or a veteran collector, you’re sure to have (possibly even inadvertently)
            learned a good deal about CryptoPunks by now. A collection of 10,000 unique NFTs, CryptoPunks is arguably
            the most influential avatar collection ever made.</main>
        <main>Launched in June of 2017 by product studio Larva Labs, these Punks were some of the first NFTs ever minted
            on the Ethereum blockchain. Featuring humans, apes, zombies, and aliens, CryptoPunks pioneered the idea of
            generative trait combinations that most other PFP projects still draw inspiration from today.</main>
        <main>Bored Ape Yacht Club</main>
        <main>Second only to CryptoPunks in importance is the Bored Ape Yacht Club. Also a collection of 10,000 NFTs,
            with collectors all over the world, BAYC has become arguably the most beloved and embraced project in all of
            NFTs.</main>
        <main>BAYC launched in April 2021, and although it experienced a slow start, the project exploded in value over
            the following months. Early supporters who have diamond-handed even one Ape currently have the opportunity
            to cash out at well over $300,000. </main>
        <main>However, the general consensus throughout the NFT space seems to be that the most exciting aspect of the
            Bored Ape Yacht Club is its community, which in the last year has expanded to encompass collections like
            Mutant Apes, Kennel Club dogs, and of course the slowly evolving Otherside project. </main>
        <main>Azuki</main>
        <main>Azuki is an anime-themed avatar project that launched in January 2022 and quickly burned a hot trail
            through the NFT charts. Featuring 10,000 NFTs, the goal of the project seems to be to create the largest
            decentralized metaverse brand, built and owned by the community. </main>
        <main>While we’ve seen many a project journey down a similar path — either anime-themed or aiming to become a
            household name, or both — Azuki was one of the fastest-growing projects the NFT space has ever seen.</main>
        <main>However, the endeavor hit a pretty major snag in May 2022 when the project’s founders were discovered to
            have abandoned at least three previous prominent projects. Just a few days after the news broke, the price
            of an Azuki dropped by more than half on OpenSea, and it has since struggled to recover.</main>
        <main>Clone X</main>
        <main>Clone X is a joint venture between metaverse fashion house RTFKT and renowned multimedia artist Takashi
            Murakami. Featuring 20,000 NFTs, the Clone X collection has kept the collective NFT community on its toes
            with announcements about numerous Nike integrations.</main>
        <main>Since the initial Clone X PFP collection first sold out in November 2021, the project has evolved to
            encompass numerous secondary initiatives including Space Pods, MNLTHs, and more. With new and exciting
            virtual and real-world expansions happening on a near-monthly basis, the initial Clone X collection
            continues to gain popularity with both new and seasoned NFT collectors.</main>
        <main>Moonbirds</main>
        <main>Moonbirds is a collection of 10,000 NFTs created by prominent American internet entrepreneur Kevin Rose as
            part of his Proof Collective — a private members-only collective of NFT collectors and artists. </main>
        <main>Only a few days after its April 2022 launch, Moonbirds had already achieved upwards of 100,000 ETH
            (approximately $300 million at the time) in secondary sales volume, immediately making it one of the
            highest-grossing NFT collections of all time. Aside from the typical PFP NFT roadmap promises, the Moonbirds
            collection offers a wide range of incentives to its collectors.</main>
        <main>Doodles</main>
        <main>Doodles is a project created by a team with a proven track record as builders within the NFT space.
            Consisting of 10,000 playful line-drawn avatars, Doodles has easily become one of the most popular PFP
            projects in all of NFTs.</main>
        <main>Only a few months after its October 2021 launch, Doodles quickly became an influential project within and
            outside of the NFT community. Although it received a bit of backlash due to the Doodle devs privatizing the
            Discord prior to launch, as a laundry list of prominent celebrities have bought in, the community sentiment
            is improving.</main>
        <main>With innovative token mechanics and unique secondary collections continuing to be rolled out, Doodles is
            winning over the hearts of countless NFT enthusiasts and veteran NFT collectors.</main>
        <main>Cool Cats</main>
        <main>When it comes to community-driven projects, Cool Cats is a tough one to beat. A collection of 9,999
            generated and, as the developers say, “stylistically curated” NFTs, the collection launched in June 2021,
            going toe to toe with Gutter Cat Gang (also included on this list) for the title of hottest new cat-themed
            PFP project.</main>
        <main>Since its launch, Cool Cats has earned accolades in the NFT space as a fun and inclusive project. With the
            collection floor achieving 10 ETH at one point — propelled by collaborations with Ghxsts and TIME magazine,
            plus a near viral milk chug challenge — the Cats are a definite fan favorite of PFP projects.</main>
        <main>CrypToadz</main>
        <main>Inspired by Larva Labs’ iconic CryptoPunks, CrypToadz — a collection of 6,969 NFTs — was conceived by now
            prominent anonymous artist Gremplin during a time when PFP and Punk-derivative projects saturated the
            market.</main>
        <main>Gremplin’s ambitious amphibious collection has racked up impressive sales volume since its launch in
            September 2021. Beyond becoming one of the most influential PFP projects of the year, Toadz has received
            praise from some of the most prominent NFT collectors and investors around. </main>
        <main>World of Women</main>
        <main>World of Women (WoW) was a refreshing entry on the list of 2021 PFP projects. Totaling 10,000 NFTs, while
            this collection may be generative, it’s one of the only projects to give a human spin to the avatar craze.
        </main>
        <main>Launched in July 2021, each WoW NFT was created from an array of traits crafted in the unique, colorful
            style of Yam Karkai. With a portion of proceeds from the primary sale donated to charity and another
            reinvested back in crypto art, WoW easily became an NFT community favorite. Even Reese Witherspoon has
            become a fan, showing off #8072 on Twitter.</main>
        <main>Pudgy Penguins</main>
        <main>Pudgy Penguins is a collection of 8,888 penguin-themed NFTs that is said to be a beacon of positivity in
            the NFT Space. Since its July 2021 launch, the collection has bootstrapped a robust ecosystem of NFT
            enthusiasts.</main>
        <main>Yet, the project also has an interesting and controversial past. In Dec. 2021, a Pudgy Penguins community
            moderator exited the team, accusing the leaders of the project of being shady and ineffective, and even
            revealing that one of the project’s leaders had attempted to buy his silence with a bribe of 1 ETH. The
            project has since been handed over to new management and is still growing and expanding.</main>
