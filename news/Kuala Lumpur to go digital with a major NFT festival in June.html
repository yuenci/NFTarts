        <main>Immerse yourself in the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) at M1NTED, a two-day event to be held at the
            Kuala Lumpur Performing Arts Centre (KLPac) on June 4 and 5.</main>
        <main>Brought to you by The Livescape Group, an award-winning creative and business incubator based in
            South-East Asia, M1NTED comprises two segments: the conference and the festival area.</main>
        <main>What are NFTs? All kinds of digital objects - images, videos, music, texts, tweets - can be turned into an
            NFT. It is generally built using the same kind of programming as cryptocurrency, like Ethereum.</main>
        <main>But where cryptocurrencies - just like physical money - are fungible, meaning they can be exchanged or
            traded for one another, each NFT has a digital signature that makes it unique and unexchangeable (hence,
            non-fungible).</main>
        <main>The event is open to everyone, from enthusiasts and experts, to the curious masses who might be new to
            this phenomenon.</main>
        <main>It will feature an exciting line-up of speakers, panel discussions on art, gaming and music, NFT showcases
            and other fun activities.</main>
        <main>“As the world embraces the world of web3, NFTs cannot be ignored. We believe that M1NTED can be a platform
            for the idealists, futurists and the most important aspect of all movements, the community, to connect,
            collaborate and co-create,” says Iqbal Ameer, founder and chief executive officer of The Livescape Group.
        </main>
        <main>Web3 refers to a decentralised online ecosystem based on blockchain technology.</main>
        <main>Unlike much of what we are familiar with now, where a huge share of communication and commerce takes place
            on closed platforms owned by a a few powerful corporations, the idea is that platforms built on Web3 won’t
            be owned by a central gatekeeper, but rather by users, who will help to develop and maintain these services.
