            But Damian Thompson, then a cashier, approached the man without thinking twice. Thirty years ago, Thompson
            was the first
            Black teller at the bank where he worked, and sensed that certain customers did not want to be served by
            him. That
            experience taught him the value of ensuring that everyone was included and given the same service.

            Over time, by listening to that customer,s needs and gaining trust, Thompson managed to secure a major
            investment for
            the bank. This habit is something that he carries with him today as the Group Managing Director of Retail at
            UK-based
            Aldermore. He is always looking for ways to improve the bank's service.
