        <h1>1. What are NFTs and how do they work?</h1>
        <main>Non-Fungible in the sense that they are unique and cannot be interchanged like fungible assets such as
            Bitcoin. Let’s
            take for example if you exchange a Bitcoin to get another, nothing changes, you still get the same Bitcoin
            back — it’s
            the opposite in the case of NFTs.</main>
        <main>Each NFT has a distinct signature used to designate and verify ownership of assets — there is no two
            original copy.</main>
        <main>NFTs are digital assets that are usually representations of real-world objects such as in-game items,
            videos, music,
            collectibles, virtual assets, and arts. These crypto-assets are largely part of the Ethereum network,
            however, there
            have been other versions of NTFs implemented on other blockchains such as Algorand, Tron, WAX, Tezos, EOS,
            Solana,
            Cardano, Binance Smart Chain, and Flow.</main>
        <h1>2. Why does NFT art have value? </h1>
        <main>The first is the “market-driven value”, which depends on the speculated resale value and popularity of the
            artist. The
            second is the “subjective value”. It involves the moral statement or political message that is conveyed by
            the art — how
            it makes you feel.</main>
        <main>Another value determinant of NFT arts is the “objective value”. This involves the experience and technical
            skill by
            which it was created. Lastly is the “historical value” the piece of digital art has</main>
        <main>All these factors contribute to how people value NFTs. “The Merge” which sold at an auction for a whopping
            USD 91.8
            million is the most expensive artwork ever. Each NFT created or minted is unique, and its right can be
            traced to the
            owner, and blockchain technology protects this right of ownership.</main>
        <h1>3. What are NFTs used for?</h1>
        <main>NFTs can be used to indicate ownership of rare assets which represents real-world items like real estate
            and artwork.</main>
        <main>It’s important to note however that purchasing an NFT that includes the copyright of the original artwork
            does not mean
            its copyright is automatically transferred to you. While you can sell the NFT itself, you are prohibited
            from
            reproducing or selling its content.</main>
        <h1>4. Can I create my NFT? How much does it cost to create NFTs?</h1>
        <main>The process of creating or minting an NFT is listed below:</main>
        <ul>
            <li>Step 1: Choose a platform where your wish to sell your NFT</li>
            <li>Step 2: Set up a Wallet</li>
            <li>Step 3: Connect your Wallet</li>
            <li>Step 4: Create an NFT (the cost of creation depends on the quality and size of the artwork).</li>
            <li>Step 5: List your NFT</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>5. How much energy/power do NFTs use?</h1>
        <main>According to research by a computational artist and engineer, Memo Akten, the process of minting NFTs uses
            over 263,538
            kWh of energy on average and causes emissions of 163,486 KgCO2.</main>
        <h1>6. What is the environmental impact of NTFs?</h1>
        <main>One harmful trait both NFTs and Bitcoin share is their massive use of energy. Thus their environmental
            impact is
            similar.</main>
        <main>NFT arts are sold and authenticated using energy-intensive computer transactions. These transactions are
            required for
            minting NFTs, to bid and pay for the NFT after successful bidding, as well as the process of transferring
            ownership.</main>
        <h1>7. How can I get NFTs for free? </h1>
        <main>The easiest way to earn NFTs is to create your own. You can create an NFT art for free to pad out your
            wallet. NFT
            marketplaces such as OpenSea offer a “lazy minting” approach to creating NFTs which doesn’t require any
            upfront fee from
            users.</main>
        <h1>8. Can JPEGs be NFTs? </h1>
        <main>No. A lot of people seem to mistake NFT for the external media it’s tethered to such as documentation,
            tickets, JPEGs,
            etc., — which diminishes the concept of the token itself.</main>
        <h1>9. Can NFTs be copied? </h1>
        <main>No, and Yes. While the technology “NFT” cannot be replicated because of security factors inherited from
            blockchain, the
            media can be copied easily.</main>
        <main>Take, for example, the Mona Lisa painting done by Leonardo da Vinci, while there are many lookalikes and
            iterations of
            the original painting, there is no two original Mona Lisa artwork. The same goes for NFT, it’s impossible to
            fake the
            creator’s wallet even though copying the contents of an NFT can be done.</main>
        <main>NFTs contain unique codes — stored on the blockchain in an immutable form — that makes it possible to
            trace them back to
            the creator. Read our detailed article here on where NFTs are stored.</main>
        <h1>10. Will NFTs last?</h1>
        <main>The questions as to the durability of NFTs have generated mixed opinions due to the many uncertainties as
            regards its
            use case.</main>
        <main>Experts believe that projects based on strong fundamentals are likely to survive the test of time,
            however, that can be
            said about weaker ones.</main>
        <main>Projects that are most likely to lose the fizz are NFT collections that lack utilities.</main>
        <h1>11. Can I make money in NFTs as much as Crypto coins?</h1>
        <main>You do not need to possess a special skill to buy or sell an NFT. Musicians, Artists, Social media
            influencers, and
            videographers can create NFT. All you need to show is that you legally have the right to the ownership of
            the NFT,
            anyone can Mint NFT too.</main>
        <h1>12. What is the future of NFTs?</h1>
        <main>OpenSea co-founder Alex Atallah said in an email that “the possibilities of NFTs are endless since they
            can be used to
            log ownership of any unique asset.” Using NFTs as event tickets, software licenses, fan club memberships, or
            other
            interactive experiences is already a common use case for NFTs.</main>
